# EPAI_Assignment_18

This assignment involves creating custom serialization and deserialization mechanisms for Stock and Trade classes using Python's json module and the Marshmallow library. The task includes implementing a custom JSONEncoder and decoder to handle these objects, and also using Marshmallow schemas for easy serialization/deserialization. It further includes testing the correctness of these implementations using various test cases with different data types, including Decimal and datetime.
